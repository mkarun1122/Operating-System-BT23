# Operating-System
-------------------

I. COURSE OVERVIEW:

Operating system course gives you skills and ways to think about common services for computer programs.
It is designed to provide an in-depth critique of the problems of resource management, scheduling,
concurrency, synchronization, memory management, file management, peripheral management, protection,
and security. It deals with the transfer of programs in and out of memory; and organizes processing time
between programs and users. Learned knowledge will be implemented in the design and development of
hybrid operating systems, command control systems, and real-time environments.

III. COURSE OUTCOMES:
At the end of the course, students should be able to:
CO1 Demonstrate different architectures used in the design of modern operating systems.
CO2 Solve problems related to process scheduling, synchronization, and deadlock handling in uniprocessor
and multi-processing systems.
CO3 Implement memory allocation algorithms for effective utilization of resources.
CO4 Select various page replacement algorithms applied for the allocation of frames...
CO5 Analyze different file allocation methods and disk scheduling algorithms applied for efficient
utilization of storage.
CO6 Outline mechanisms used in the protection of resources in real-time environment
